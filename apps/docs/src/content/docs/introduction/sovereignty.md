With zugriff, a WeltByte GmbH product, we embarked on a mission to design and develop a cutting-edge
hosting platform that fulfils the specific requirements of European companies, institutions,
citizens and everyone who shares our values.

Building our platform as portable as possible allows us to partner with any company to provide
you, our user, with the best cost-benefit without being reliant on any cloud service. This also
allows you to self-host zugriff on your system even if air-gapped. Please get in touch if your
organisation is interested in self-hosting.

## GDPR compliance

We host our platform on servers managed and provided by European-headquartered companies to avoid a
conflict in the precedence of national law of countries outside the jurisdiction of the European
Union.

Find an up-to-date list of companies we use to provide our services, what data we collect and how we
handle your data in our [privacy policy](https://zugriff.eu/privacy-policy).
