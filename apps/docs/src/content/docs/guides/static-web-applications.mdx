title: Static Web Apps
---

Static Web Apps do not run on the server but on a users browser. Deploying a Static Web App
can be as simple as executing the following command.

```zsh
zugriff deploy --deploymentToken <TOKEN> --asset ./index.html
```

The command line interface will derive appropriate redirects (e.g. `/` to `/index.html`).
To use [puppets](/concepts/processors/#puppets), which resolve to a static asset
instead of throwing a redirect, pass the `--preferPuppets` flag.

If you have a JavaScript file at the root of your current working directory or inside a
`src` folder, disable function discovery with `--disableFunctionDiscovery`.

:::note
To check what is being deployed, attach `--dryRun` or replace `deploy` with `pack`. `pack`
will generate the required
[configuration file](/reference/deployment-architecture/#configuration),
[folder structure](/reference/deployment-architecture/#_top),
and copy assets to `.zugriff`. Attach the `--pack` flag to the `deploy` sub-command to
build `.zugriff` from scratch before deploying.

## Asset discovery

### Roots

Let's assume the following project structure.

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>

- dist
  - index.html
  - main.js
- public
  - favicon.ico
  - .well-known
    - security.txt

</FileTree>

The output of a Vite build is written to `dist`, while `public` contains static assets to be
included in the deployment. In order for the contents of both `dist` and `public` to be at
the root level of a deployment (e.g. `example.com/index.html`, `example.com/favicon.ico`),
instead of preserving the folder with `--asset ./public`, flatten `public` using
`--asset ./public/*`. In this example, flattening `public` will not affect `.well-known` and
preserve the path of `./public/.well-known/security.txt` (`example.com/.well-known/security.txt`).

  You might want to look into catching 404s using interceptors and using guards
  to password-protect your application. TLDR; `--intercept 404:/404.html`,
  `--guard user:pass`, `--guard user:pass:/secrets.txt`.
