title: Command Line Interface
---

The command line interface will help you communicate with our API, quickly scaffold
simple projects using Hono or bundle your application into a proper deployment.

:::note
The CLI might ask you to install [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) or
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). You will not have to abort and will be able to
choose how to install dependencies.
:::

:::tip
Add `-h` or `--help` to any command for more information or `-y` to accept defaults.
:::

## Subcommands

### `new`

Used to create a new project at a specific location. Add `--typescript` to create a
project using Typescript.

```sh
zugriff new my-project
```

### `init`

Similar to `new`, a new project is created. The location of the project will be your
current working directory. The `--typescript` flag remains optional.

```sh
zugriff init --typescript
```

### `preview`

:::caution
We advise against using `preview` to serve a deployment outside your local network.
:::

Used to preview a project. A `.zugriff` must be present. Alternatively, appropriate
flags must be set. The `--watch` flag will listen for changes in your current
working directory and restart the server accordingly.

Flags will not result in a modified configuration. Instead, deploy `.zugriff` with
the same flags, use the `pack` command or rebuild your project using an adapter.

Note that a (modified) `.zugriff` folder might be left behind when panicking.

Please see the `deploy` or `pack` subcommands for available flags.

```sh
zugriff preview
```

### `deploy`

Used to create a deployment of a project. Flags allow you to adjust deployment
behaviour.

- Specify a deployment token with `--deploymentToken <TOKEN>`\*
- Specify a deployment name with `--name <NAME>` (e.g. `"docs: fix typo"`)
- Connect a deployment with an existing domain `--promote <LABEL>` (e.g.
  `production`)
- Debug the `deploy` subcommand with `--dryRun` to output helpful information (e.g.
  size, assets, functions, processors)

The following flags can be used across the `deploy`, `pack` and `preview`
subcommands.

- Change your current working directory with `--cwd <CWD>` (e.g. `./my-app/`)
- Help discover a function with `--function <FUNCTION>` (e.g. `./src/not-index.js`)
- Disable automatic function discovery with `--disableFunctionDiscovery`
- Attach an asset with `--asset <ASSET>` or `-a <ASSET>` (e.g. `./public`,
  `./public/index.html` `./*`)
- Intercept a response with an asset using the status code with `--intercept
  <INTERCEPT>` (e.g. `404:/404.html`)
- Attach a puppet with `--puppet <PUPPET>` to resolve a path to a static asset
  (e.g. `/:/index.html`, _`path:location`_)
- Throw a redirect with `--redirect <REDIRECT>` (e.g. `/:308:/index.html`,
  _`path:status:location`_)
- Pack a Next.js or custom application before deploying with `--pack`
- Disable the automatic router configuration (e.g. `/:301:/index.html`) with
  `--disableStaticRouter`\*\*
- Enable the automatic router configuration (e.g. `/:301:/index.html`) with
  `--enableStaticRouter`\*\*\*
- Prefer a file-based routing with `--preferFileRouter` (e.g. "/about.html" ->
  "/about")
- Automatically configure puppets instead of redirects with `--preferPuppets`
- Password-protect a path with `--guard <GUARD>` or `-g <GUARD>` (e.g. "user:pass"
  or "user:pass:/secrets.txt")
- Configure a caching strategy for assets with `--assetCacheControl 
<ASSET_CACHE_CONTROL>` (`no-cache`, `no-store` and `max-age=n` are supported, e.g.
  `no-cache:/main-menu.pdf`)

\* _Required_ \

### `uninstall`

:::note
On Windows you will have to remove specific files manually. The output of this
command will tell you what files to remove.
:::

```sh
zugriff uninstall
```
