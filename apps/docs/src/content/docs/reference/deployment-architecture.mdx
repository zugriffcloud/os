Our CLI or Integration will take care of bundling your application.

    - index.js
  - assets
    - favicon.ico
    - ...

</FileTree>

Note, that a deployment does not need to include a function handling dynamic content but can consist of static files only. While this goes both ways, beware that when missing a function, there is no way to route traffic hitting `/` to `index.html` for example. The CLI will automatically detect and generate such routing file.

# Configuration

A configuration file must be located at `.zugriff/config.json`. It must list included assets and functions.
Files not listed in the configuration file will be stripped from the deployment.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "functions": [{ "path": "/index.js", "pattern": "*" }],
  "puppets": {},
  "redirects": [],
  "assets": ["/favicon.ico", "/404.html" ...],
  "interceptors": [{ "status": 404, "method": "GET", "path": "/404.html" }]
}
```

Please note that both file and asset paths referenced in the configuration file must be absolute from within their respected roots.

## Functions

zugriff supports multiple dynamic entrypoints in a deployment. We forward requests a dynamic entrypoints according to wildcard patterns
(expressions) applied to the path of a request.

While catch-all patterns can be placed first, any other available pattern is checked for a match first. Duplicate patterns are simply
overwritten.

### Patterns

While patterns might look like regular expressions, they are not. A pattern consists of a wildcard characters that are flexible
in size and type and regular characters that are not.
For instance, `*` will match any path while `/prefix/*` will match any path prefixed with `/prefix/` and `*hello*` will match
any path containing `hello`.

Note, the path itself will start and end with `/` when checked for matches. The function, however, will receive the original path.
