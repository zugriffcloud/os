After developing your application and configuring your routes to run on the edge runtime, you can use
[`@cloudflare/next-on-pages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/next-on-pages) to build your
application for both Cloudflare Pages and zugriff.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Configure your routes and API endpoints

   ```diff lang="tsx"
   // page|endpoint.tsx|ts
   + export const runtime = 'edge';

   export default function Page() {
     return (...);
   }
   ```

2. (Optional) Configure "next/image"

   ```diff lang="js"
   // next.config.js

   ...
   images: {
     ...
   +  unoptimized: true
   }
   ```

3. Build your application with [`@cloudflare/next-on-pages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/next-on-pages)

   ```zsh
    npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages
   ```

4. Deploy and Forget.

   ```zsh
    zugriff deploy
   ```

</Steps>
